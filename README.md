Local radios ownership and elections
I believe failures were caused by blank cells- data came from five elections results (2000, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2016), and 
most candidates did not run for all of them. Since there are no blank cells in $DEP and $ANT columns, I believe everything is 
ok with the t.test results. By the way, I have 134 observations (after (DEP) and before (ANT) the treatment). They were 
measured as a percentage (0% to 100%). That's why I ran a paired t.test. The difference between $DEP and $ANT can be 0, a 
positive number or a negative number - that's why a two-tailed test is requested. Wish you could analyse the codes to see if I 
did not commit a mistake, and if, eventually, I can eliminate the mistakes created by the blank cells. Thank you!
